== Using the Github API

Once you know how you want to setup a workflow you may wish to automate some or all of it,
to make the life of your team easier. This way you can provide a set of tools, which can be run 
from a command line, as plugins for your favorite tool, or as part of a web interface.

Of course as git is a command line tool a shell script can be written that will do many of the standard 
git operations. So for example you could take some raw data, populate some templates, commit them into
git and push them up to a server. [TODO talk about github's web hosting]

However if you want to do something more complex then you may wish to use the github api which lets
you access many of the features of github programmaticly instead of doing them via the web interface.
