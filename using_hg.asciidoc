== Using HG

While GIT is the major DVCS in use Mucruial (also known as hg) is also being used 
by a number of projects. In many cases the basic ideas of git and HG are pretty similar,
so if you have been using one switching to the other should not require much of a learning
curve. 

NOTE: HG is the chemical symbol for murcury, so that is the short name. All those 
of you who remember high school or college chemestry class didn't need to read this.

There are of course a number of technical differences in the internal of git and HG but 
they are beyond the scope of this work.
