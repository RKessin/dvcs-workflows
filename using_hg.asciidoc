== Using HG

While GIT is the major DVCS in use Mucruial (also known as hg) is also
being used by a number of projects. In many cases the basic ideas of
git and HG are pretty similar, so if you have been using one switching
to the other should not require much of a learning curve.

NOTE: HG is the chemical symbol for murcury, so that is the short
name. All those of you who remember high school or college chemestry
class didn't need to read this.

There are of course a number of technical differences in the internal
of git and HG but they are beyond the scope of this book as I really
want to focus on how to effectivly use these tools to get work
done. How the internals work are not really important, if you care of
course then there are a number of books, videos and web sites that
will cover that.

NOTE: TODO how to use HG
