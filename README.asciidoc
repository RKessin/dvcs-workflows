== DVCS Workflows


In the last few years many developers have moved from old style
version control systems like CVS and SVN to new Distributed Version
Control Systems like HG and GIT. Which offer a lot more power and
flexibility for development teams. 

When using SVN (or CVS) there is really only one workflow that can be
used. Everyone checks in to one central repository and every commit is
exposed to every developer. Thus it is impossible to check in partial
work without risking Breaking the build. In addition branches are a
pain to use.

However in making this transition many teams have not realized that
there are many ways to setup a team workflow with a DVCS system. This
book aims to explore some of those setups and explain why they work
for that team. 

This ebook may eventually turn into a real book.
