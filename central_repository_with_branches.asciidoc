One way to work with a small group is to have one central repository
and then have all new development happen in a series of branches. Each
feature is implemented in its own branch and when code review and
testing are complete the code is merged into the master branch from
which the final build is constructed and shipped.

In order for this work flow to work then your team must have good
discipline as anyone can integrate code into the master branch and
ship that code.
