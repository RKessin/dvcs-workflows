== Workflow Planning

One of the great advantages of a DVCS is that there is not one
prescribed workflow. Teams are free to figure out what will work best
for them. The great disadvantage is that since there is not one
prescribed workflow teams have to figure that out.

In addition as a project and team evolve the ideal workflow may change
over time.
