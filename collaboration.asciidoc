== Tools for Collaboration


When working with a group on a project you need to have a way to
integrate the contributions of various team members. 

It is possible to write in software like MS Word and email copies of
the files around between collaborators. However this is a risky
practice. As revisions of the file move around the number of versions
of the file will go up. Trying to ensure that changes are not
overwritten by mistake becomes an increasing difficult task.
