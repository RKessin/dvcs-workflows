If you are devloping a project solo many of the compexities of a group are greatly simpified, 
As there is only one team member she does not need to coridnate with team members. 

There are two aspects of how to work on a project solo. How to best take advantage of the features
of git such as branches and how to take best advantage of cloud hosting.

I have found that while working solo or in a group using frequent small branches makes life simple. 
For each new feature I create a new branch and do the development I want to do. When I have fished 
the feature I merge it back into the main branch.

I tend to use bitbucket for solo projects. Unlike github bitbucket allows you to have have unlimted 
private repositories. As I don't care about community in this case giving up github's features doesn't bother
me as I am working solo. 

I do however want to use a cloud host as I may be using the project from several computes. I may wish to 
have access to the files from my desktop, my laptop and a cloud server. t c
